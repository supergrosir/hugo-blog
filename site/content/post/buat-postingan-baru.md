**Online store builders let you start selling online for a fraction of the price you’d pay for a pair of shoes.**

You’ll need to sign up to an ecommerce plan to connect to payment processors allowing you to take payments from customers when you start selling clothes online.

As well as being easy and economical to use, online store builders will also take care of all the technical stuff so you don’t have to.

You can start selling clothes online in no time without having to worry about security upgrades and hacking risks. Online store builders also give you an SSL certificate.

SSL certificates provide secure, encrypted communications between your website and your customers’ internet browser. This means that all credit card transactions and data transfers are safe and secure.

Having an SSL certificate is like having security tags in all your clothing to prevent shoplifting, except you don’t have to install or maintain them!

Online store builders take care of this for you so your clothing store will be safe from hackers – the internet equivalent of shoplifters, although they’re looking for data not clothes!

But which builder should you choose? With so much choice, it can be difficult to know where to start.

This is where we come in to help you figure out which is best for your needs. Why not get started with this chart that compares our top three ecommerce platforms!
