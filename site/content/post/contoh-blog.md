  Selling clothes online is a competitive undertaking. In order to attract
  customers to your online clothing store (and away from the competition), you
  will have to get found on search engines.

This means that you need to think about optimizing your store for search engines. First of all you’ll want to have a keyword focused page title and meta description.

Your page title is the blue link you see in the search results and the meta description is the text underneath it that gives you an insight into what that page is about.

Keywords are what people search for to arrive at your online clothing store. They are terms that are related to what is on your online store.

For example, if you’re selling women’s vintage clothing and accessories, your keywords might be: ‘vintage clothing,’ women’s vintage clothing’ ‘vintage accessories,’ and ‘women’s vintage accessories.’

To show Google that your store is relevant to those keywords, you will need to use them in your page title and meta description.

Another thing you’ll want to do is make sure your site is structured in a way that Google can find all of your content.

This will help your store to appear in more search results. **It also has the added benefit of helping your customers navigate quickly and easily around your store.**

For example, if someone searches ‘blue denim jacket’ then having good site structure might make your blue denim shirt product page rank in search engine results pages (SERPs) because your homepage more than likely won’t.

This is because it is not tailored to this specific search term as it is more of a general page (not specifically about blue denim jackets).

A logical site structure improves visibility to Google, which means more traffic to your site and ultimately more profits.

To do this make sure your pages link to one another, for example have a link back to your home page from your product pages.

This not only makes Google happy, but will keep your customer happy too as they can easily navigate around your store. And we all know the saying: ‘a happy customer is a loyal customer,’ so your SEO strategy isn’t only gaining new customers but is helping to turn them into returning ones.

Online store builders often hold your hand through the SEO process, but we’ve found Wix to be particularly good at this. Wix has its own SEO Wiz that creates a tailor made SEO plan for you.

Wix’s SEO Wiz gives you a clear checklist of things you need to do, making it very easy to make your online clothing store search engine and customer friendly!\[/caption]
